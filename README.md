- **Resource Tracking**
  - Record real-time resource location and status
  - Store activity histories for auditing and analysis
  - Set and monitor operational boundaries
  - Track boundary and compliance violations

- **Maintenance & Lifecycle Management**
  - Schedule preventive maintenance and updates
  - Log completed maintenance with verification
  - Track resource modifications and replacements
  - Store complete operational histories
  - Monitor service provider certifications

- **Operator Management**
  - Register and track operator profiles
  - Manage certifications and qualifications
  - Monitor performance metrics
  - Handle resource assignments
  - Track operator availability and authorization
